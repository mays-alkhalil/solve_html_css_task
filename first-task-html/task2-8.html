    <p><mark>Kittens love to play - one minute they are full of beans and the next they’</mark>ll be zonked out, asleep where they fall. The best way to play with your kitten is to encourage play with different toys including ones that they can interact with alone (such as ball circuits) and ones that you can use together (fishing rods are always a winner but always make sure your kitten is supervised). 

        Rotate the types of toys that your kitten is using so that they don’t get bored. If you notice that your kitten is showing predatory behaviour (stalking, pouncing, jumping, biting, or clawing), then they might be bored - you can distract them from this by using toys for physical and mental enrichment. 
        
        You may be tempted to use your fingers or your toes to play with your kitten, but you should avoid this. If they believe this is an acceptable form of play, you may end up with a few injuries when they’ve grown into an adult cat! This type of inappropriate play is very common in kittens. So it’s important to teach them by using positive reinforcement and not by telling them off. Ignore unwanted behaviours so as to not inadvertently encourage them by reacting. If they are using your feet as a toy, stay completely still so that they are no longer ‘prey’.
