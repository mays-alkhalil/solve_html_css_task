    <h1>Welcome to Coding Intro</h1>

    <h2>About Programming</h2>
    <p>Programming is a way to "instruct the computer to perform various tasks". Confusing? Let us understand the definition deeply: "instruct the computer" - this basically means that you provide the computer a set of instructions that are written in a language that the computer can understand.</p>

    <h2>About HTML</h2>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</p>

    <h2>About CSS</h2>
    <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.</p>
